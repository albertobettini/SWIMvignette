Scenario weights are selected by constrained minimisation of the relative entropy to the baseline model. The SWIM package is based on the paper Pesenti S.M, Millossovich P., Tsanakas A. (2019) “Reverse Sensitivity Testing: What does it take to break the model”, doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2018.10.003. 1.1 Installation The SWIM package can be install from CRAN : https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SWIM; alternatively from GitHub in R studio: install.packages(&quot;spesenti/SWIM&quot;) "]
