Scenario weights are selected by constrained minimisation of the relative entropy to the baseline model. 1.1 Installation The SWIM package can be install from CRAN : via the link https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SWIM; alternatively from GitHub: with the following R code: install.packages(&quot;spesenti/SWIM&quot;) "]
