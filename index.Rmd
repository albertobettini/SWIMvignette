# Overview

The SWIM package provides weights on simulated scenarios from a
stochastic model, such that stressed model components (random variables)
fulfil given probabilistic constraints (e.g. specified values for risk
measures), under the new scenario weights. Scenario weights are selected
by constrained minimisation of the relative entropy to the baseline
model. The SWIM package is based on the paper Pesenti S.M, Millossovich P., Tsanakas A. (2019) "Reverse Sensitivity Testing: What does it take to break the model", [doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2018.10.003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2018.10.003).


## Installation

The SWIM package can be install from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SWIM) :

<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SWIM>;

alternatively from [GitHub](https://github.com/spesenti/SWIM) in R studio:


``` r}
install.packages("spesenti/SWIM")
```
