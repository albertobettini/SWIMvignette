Scenario weights are selected by constrained minimisation of the relative entropy to the baseline model. 1.1 Installation The SWIM package can be install from CRAN : https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SWIM; alternatively from GitHub in R studio: install.packages(&quot;spesenti/SWIM&quot;) "],

Starting from a baseline probability, \\(P\\), a probability measure describing the current beliefs regarding (or software implementation of) the model, we are interested in stressed models that fulfil probabilistic constraints and have minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence. Specifically, a stressed model \\(Q\\) is the solution to \\[\\begin{equation} \\min_{ Q \\in \\mathcal{P}} D_\\text{KL}(Q \\| P), \\quad \\text{s.t. probabilistic constraints of the model under }Q \\text{ hold}, \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] where the Kullback-Leibler divergence is given by \\(D_\\text{KL}(Q \\| P) = \\int \\frac{dQ}{dP} \\log \\big(\\frac{dQ}{dP} \\big)\\mathrm{d}P\\), if \\(Q\\) is absolutely continuous with respect to \\(P\\). The optimisation (4.1) with moment constraint has been studied by (Csisz√°r 1975). 4.2 Stresses The SWIM package provides sensitivity analysis tools for stressing model components (random variables). Implemented stresses are: R function Stress stress() a wrapper for the stress_ functions stress_VaR() VaR risk measure, a quantile stress_VaR_ES() VaR and ES risk measures stress_mean() means stress_mean_sd() means and standard deviations stress_mean_moment() moments, functions of moments stress_prob() probabilities of intervals stress_user() user defined scenario weights 4.3 Visual tools References "],

Point of view of an insurer who aims at building up a partial internal model for a portfolio of life annuities.

It can be split in process and longevity risk. - The investment risk originates from the randomness stemming from financial markets in which the insurer invests. \\ Annuitants same age \\(x\\) at entry time \\(t=0\\) (when they buy the annuity) \\(\\rightarrow\\) single cohort.
