Scenario weights are selected by constrained minimisation of the relative entropy to the baseline model. The SWIM package is based on Pesenti, Millossovich, and Tsanakas (2019). 1.1 Installation The SWIM package can be install from CRAN : https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SWIM; alternatively from GitHub in R studio: install.packages(&quot;spesenti/SWIM&quot;) References "]
